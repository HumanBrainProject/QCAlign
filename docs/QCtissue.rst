**Quality control assessment of histological slice images**
========================================================

The tissue quality or histology integrity of the slices in a series can
be assessed with the **(x)** marker. This assessment is completed
independently of the accurate, inaccurate, and uncertain series
assessment.

-  **Damage: (x**) **Quadruple click, Keyboard shortcut: 5** Use this
   marker for grid points positioned over areas that should not be
   included in the analysis. For example, overlaying areas with tissue
   damage, artifacts such as air bubbles, or parts of the image that are
   out-of-focus.

-  **An example image for this marker is given at the end of this
   section.**
